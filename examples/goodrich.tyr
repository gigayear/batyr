  <slug>NIGHT SEQUENCE</slug>
  <p>
    Series of shots of various streets and buildings in the town of Bedford
    Falls, somewhere in New York State. The streets are deserted, and snow is
    falling. It is Christmas Eve. Over the above scenes we hear voices praying:
  </p>
  <cue>GOWER'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    I owe everything to George Bailey.  Help him, dear Father.
  </d>
  <cue>MARTINI'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Joseph, Jesus and Mary. Help my friend Mr.\ Bailey.
  </d>
  <cue>MRS.\ BAILEY'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Help my son George tonight.
  </d>
  <cue>BERT'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    He never thinks about himself, God; that's why he's in trouble.
  </d>
  <cue>ERNIE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    George is a good guy. Give him a break, God.
  </d>
  <cue>MARY'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    I love him, dear Lord. Watch over him tonight.
  </d>
  <cue>JANIE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Please, God. Something's the matter with Daddy.
  </d>
  <cue>ZUZU'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Please bring Daddy back.
  </d>
  <p>
    CAMERA PULLS UP from the Bailey home and travels up through the sky until it
    is above the falling snow and moving slowly toward a firmament full of
    stars. As the camera stops we hear the following heavenly voices talking,
    and as each voice is heard, one of the stars twinkles brightly:
  </p>
  <cue>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Hello, Joseph, trouble?
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Looks like we'll have to send someone down — a lot of people are asking for
    help for a man named George Bailey.
  </d>
  <cue>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    George Bailey. Yes, tonight's his crucial night. You're right, we'll have to
    send someone down immediately.  Whose turn is it?
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    That's why I came to see you, sir.  It's that clock-maker's turn again.
  </d>
  <cue>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh — Clarence. Hasn't got his wings yet, has he? We've passed him up right
    along.
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Because, you know, sir, he's got the I.Q.\ of a rabbit.
  </d>
  <cue>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Yes, but he's got the faith of a child — simple. Joseph, send for Clarence.
  </d>
  <p>
    A small star flies in from left of screen and stops. It twinkles as Clarence
    speaks:
  </p>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    You sent for me, sir?
  </d>
  <cue>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Yes, Clarence. A man down on earth needs our help.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Splendid! Is he sick?
  </d>
  <cue>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    No, worse. He's discouraged. At exactly ten-forty-five PM tonight, Earth
    time, that man will be thinking seriously of throwing away God's greatest
    gift.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, dear, dear! His life! Then I've only got an hour to dress. What are they
    wearing now?
  </d>
  <cue>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    You will spend that hour getting acquainted with George Bailey.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Sir… If I should accomplish this mission — I mean — might I perhaps win my
    wings?  I've been waiting for over two hundred years now, sir — and people
    are beginning to talk.
  </d>
  <cue>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    What's that book you've got there?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    The Adventures of Tom Sawyer.
  </d>
  <cue>FRANKLIN'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Clarence, you do a good job with George Bailey, and you'll get your wings.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, thank you, sir. Thank you.
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Poor George… Sit down.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Sit down? What are…
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    If you're going to help a man, you want to know something about him, don't
    you?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, naturally. Of course.
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, keep your eyes open. See the town?
  </d>
  <p>
    The stars fade out from the screen, and a light, indistinguishable blur is
    seen.
  </p>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Where? I don't see a thing.
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, I forgot. You haven't got your wings yet. Now look, I'll help you out.
    Concentrate. Begin to see something?
  </d>
  <p>
    The blur on the screen slowly begins to take form. We see a group of young
    boys on top of a snow-covered hill.
  </p>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Why, yes. This is amazing.
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    If you ever get your wings, you'll see all by yourself.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, wonderful!
  </d>
  <slug>EXT.\ FROZEN RIVER AND HILL - CLOSE SHOT - DAY</slug>
  <p>
    Group of boys. They are preparing to slide down the hill on large
    shovels. One of them makes the slide and shoots out onto the ice of a frozen
    river at the bottom of the hill.
  </p>
  <cue>BOY</cue>
  <dir>as he slides</dir>
  <d>
    Yippee!!
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Hey, who's that?
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    That's your problem, George Bailey.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    A boy?
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    That's him when he was twelve, back in 1919. Something happens here you'll
    have to remember later on.
  </d>
  <p>
    Series of shots as four or five boys make the slide down the hill and out
    onto the ice. As each boy comes down the others applaud.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    George Bailey at bottom of slide.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>through megaphone</dir>
  <d>
    And here comes the scare-baby, my kid brother, Harry Bailey.
  </d>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT - HARRY</slug>
  <p>
    On top of hill, preparing to make his slide.
  </p>
  <cue>HARRY</cue>
  <d>
    I'm not scared.
  </d>
  <cue>BOYS</cue>
  <dir>ad lib</dir>
  <d>
    Come on, Harry! Attaboy, Harry!
  </d>
  <slug>MED.\ SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    Harry makes his slide very fast. He passes the marks made by the other boys,
    and his shovel takes him onto the thin ice at the bend of the river. The ice
    breaks, and Harry disappears into the water.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE</slug>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    I'm coming, Harry.
  </d>
  <slug>MED.\ SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    George jumps into the water and grabs Harry. As he starts to pull him out he
    yells:
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Make a chain, gang! A chain!
  </d>
  <slug>WIDER ANGLE</slug>
  <p>
    The other boys lie flat on the ice, forming a human chain.  When George
    reaches the edge with Harry in his arms, they pull them both to safety.
  </p>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    George saved his brother's life that day.  But he caught a bad cold which
    infected his left ear. Cost him his hearing in that ear. It was weeks before
    he could return to his after- school job at old man Gower's drugstore.
  </d>
  <slug>EXT.\ MAIN STREET - BEDFORD FALLS - MED.\ SHOT - SPRING AFTERNOON</slug>
  <p>
    Five or six boys are coming toward camera, arm in arm, whistling.  Their
    attention is drawn to an elaborate horsedrawn carriage proceeding down the
    other side of the street.
  </p>
  <slug>MED.\ PAN SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    The carriage driving by. We catch a glimpse of an elderly man riding in it.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    The boys watching the carriage.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Mr.\ Potter!
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    Who's that — a king?
  </d>
  <cue>JOSEPH'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    That's Henry F.\ Potter, the richest and meanest man in the county.
  </d>
  <p>
    The boys continue until they reach Gower's drugstore. The drugstore is
    old-fashioned and dignified, with jars of colored water in the windows and
    little else. As the kids stop:
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    So long!
  </d>
  <cue>BOYS</cue>
  <dir>ad lib</dir>
  <d>
    Got to work, slave. Hee-haw. Hee- haw.
  </d>
  <slug>INT.\ DRUGSTORE - MED.\ SHOT - DAY</slug>
  <p>
    George comes in and crosses to an old-fashioned cigar lighter on the
    counter. He shuts his eyes and makes a wish:
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Wish I had a million dollars.
  </d>
  <p>
    He clicks the lighter and the flame springs up.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Hot dog!
  </d>
  <slug>WIDER ANGLE</slug>
  <p>
    George crosses over to the soda fountain, at which Mary Hatch, a small girl,
    is seated, watching him. George goes on to get his apron from behind the
    fountain.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>calling toward back room</dir>
  <d>
    It's me, Mr.\ Gower. George Bailey.
  </d>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    Mr.\ Gower, the druggist, peering from a window in back room.  We see him
    take a drink from a bottle.
  </p>
  <cue>GOWER</cue>
  <d>
    You're late.
  </d>
  <slug>MED.\ SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    George behind soda fountain. He is putting on his apron.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Yes, sir.
  </d>
  <slug>WIDER ANGLE</slug>
  <p>
    Violet Bick enters the drugstore and sits on one of the stools at the
    fountain. She is the same height as Mary and the same age, but she is
    infinitely older in her approach to people.
  </p>
  <cue>VIOLET</cue>
  <dir>with warm friendliness</dir>
  <d>
    Hello, George.
  </d>
  <dir>then, flatly, as she sees Mary</dir>
  <d>
    'Lo, Mary.
  </d>
  <cue>MARY</cue>
  <dir>primly</dir>
  <d>
    Hello, Violet.
  </d>
  <p>
    George regards the two of them with manly disgust. They are two kids to him,
    and a nuisance. He starts over for the candy counter.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Two cents worth of shoelaces?
  </d>
  <cue>VIOLET</cue>
  <d>
    She was here first.
  </d>
  <cue>MARY</cue>
  <d>
    I'm still thinking.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>to Violet</dir>
  <d>
    Shoelaces?
  </d>
  <cue>VIOLET</cue>
  <d>
    Please, Georgie.
  </d>
  <p>
    George goes over to the candy counter.
  </p>
  <cue>VIOLET</cue>
  <dir>to Mary</dir>
  <d>
    I like him.
  </d>
  <cue>MARY</cue>
  <d>
    You like every boy.
  </d>
  <cue>VIOLET</cue>
  <dir>happily</dir>
  <d>
    What's wrong with that?
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Here you are.
  </d>
  <p>
    George gives Violet a paper sack containing licorice shoelaces.  Violet
    gives him the money.
  </p>
  <cue>VIOLET</cue>
  <dir>the vamp</dir>
  <d>
    Help me down?
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>disgusted</dir>
  <d>
    Help you down!
  </d>
  <p>
    Violet jumps down off her stool and exits. Mary, watching, sticks out her
    tongue as she passes.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE AND MARY AT FOUNTAIN</slug>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Made up your mind yet?
  </d>
  <cue>MARY</cue>
  <d>
    I'll take chocolate.
  </d>
  <p>
    George puts some chocolate ice cream in a dish.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    With coconuts?
  </d>
  <cue>MARY</cue>
  <d>
    I don't like coconuts.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    You don't like coconuts!  Say, brainless, don't you know where coconuts come
    from?  Lookit here — from Tahiti — Fiji Islands, the Coral Sea!
  </d>
  <p>
    He pulls a magazine from his pocket and shows it to her.
  </p>
  <cue>MARY</cue>
  <d>
    A new magazine! I never saw it before.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Of course you never. Only us explorers can get it. I've been nominated for
    membership in the National Geographic Society.
  </d>
  <p>
    He leans down to finish scooping out the ice cream, his deaf ear toward her.
    She leans over, speaking softly.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    Mary, whispering.
  </p>
  <cue>MARY</cue>
  <d>
    Is this the ear you can't hear on?  George Bailey, I'll love you till the
    day I die.
  </d>
  <p>
    She draws back quickly and looks down, terrified at what she has said.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT - GEORGE AND MARY</slug>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    I'm going out exploring some day, you watch. And I'm going to have a couple
    of harems, and maybe three or four wives.  Wait and see.
  </d>
  <p>
    He turns back to the cash register, whistling.
  </p>
  <slug>ANOTHER ANGLE</slug>
  <p>
    Taking in entrance to prescription room at end of fountain.  Gower comes to
    the entrance. He is bleary-eyed, unshaven, chewing an old unlit cigar. His
    manner is gruff and mean. It is evident he has been drinking.
  </p>
  <cue>GOWER</cue>
  <d>
    George! George!
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Yes, sir.
  </d>
  <cue>GOWER</cue>
  <d>
    You're not paid to be a canary.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    No, sir.
  </d>
  <p>
    He turns back to the cash register when he notices an open telegram on the
    shelf. He is about to toss it aside when he starts to read it.
  </p>
  <p>
    INSERT: THE TELEGRAM
  </p>
  <p>
    It reads: “We regret to inform you that your son, Robert, died very suddenly
    this morning of influenza stop. Everything possible was done for his comfort
    stop. We await instructions from you.  EDWARD MELLINGTON Pres. HAMMERTON
    COLLEGE.”
  </p>
  <slug>BACK TO SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    George puts the telegram down. A goodness of heart expresses itself in a
    desire to do something for Gower. He gives the ice cream to Mary without
    comment and sidles back toward Gower.
  </p>
  <slug>INT.\ PRESCRIPTION ROOM OF DRUGSTORE - CLOSE SHOT - DAY</slug>
  <p>
    Gower, drunk, is intent on putting some capsules into a box.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Mr.\ Gower, do you want something…  Anything?
  </d>
  <cue>GOWER</cue>
  <d>
    No.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Anything I can do back here?
  </d>
  <cue>GOWER</cue>
  <d>
    No.
  </d>
  <p>
    George looks curiously at Gower, realizing that he is quite drunk.  Gower
    fumbles and drops some of the capsules to the floor.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    Capsules spilling on floor at their feet.
  </p>
  <p>BACK TO SHOT</p>
  <p>
    George and Gower.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    I'll get them, sir.
  </d>
  <p>
    He picks up the capsules and puts them in the box. Gower waves George aside,
    takes his old wet cigar, shoves it in his mouth and sits in an old Morris
    chair in the background.  George turns a bottle around from which Gower has
    taken the powder for the capsules. Its label reads “POISON.” George stands
    still, horrified.
  </p>
  <cue>GOWER</cue>
  <d>
    Take these capsules over to Mrs.\ Blaine's.  She's waiting for them.
  </d>
  <p>
    George picks up the capsule box, not knowing what to do or say.  His eyes
    go, harassed, to the bottle labeled poison.  George's fingers fumble.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Yes, sir. They have the diphtheria there, haven't they, sir?
  </d>
  <cue>GOWER</cue>
  <d>
    Ummmm…
  </d>
  <p>
    Gower stares moodily ahead, sucking his cigar. George turns to him, the box
    in his hand.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Is it a charge, sir?
  </d>
  <cue>GOWER</cue>
  <d>
    Yes — charge.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Mr.\ Gower, I think…
  </d>
  <cue>GOWER</cue>
  <d>
    Aw, get going!
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Yes, sir.
  </d>
  <slug>INT.\ DRUGSTORE - MED.\ SHOT - DAY</slug>
  <p>
    George comes out into main room. As he puts on his cap he sees a Sweet
    Caporals ad which says:
  </p>
  <slug>INSERT</slug>
  <p>
    “ASK DAD HE KNOWS” — SWEET CAPORAL
  </p>
  <p>BACK TO SCENE</p>
  <p>
    With an inspiration, George dashes out the door and down the street. Mary
    follows him with her eyes.
  </p>
  <slug>EXT.\ STREET - MED.\ SHOT - DAY</slug>
  <p>
    George runs down the street until he comes opposite a two-story building
    with a sign on it reading: “Bailey Building and Loan Association.” He
    stops. Potter's carriage is waiting at the entrance. Suddenly he runs up the
    stairs.
  </p>
  <slug>INT.\ OUTER OFFICE BLDG.\ AND LOAN - FULL SHOT - DAY</slug>
  <p>
    The offices are ancient and a bit on the rickety side. There is a counter
    with a grill, something like a bank. Before a door marked:
  </p>
  <p>
    “PETER BAILEY, PRIVATE”, George's Uncle Billy stands, obviously trying to
    hear what is going on inside. He is a very good-humored man of about fifty,
    in shirt-sleeves. With him at the door, also listening, are Cousin Tilly
    Bailey, a waspish-looking woman, who is the telephone operator, and Cousin
    Eustace Bailey, the clerk.  The office vibrates with an aura of crisis as
    George enters and proceeds directly toward his father's office.
  </p>

    He enters a door marked: “WILLIAM BAILEY, PRIVATE.” George stands irresolute
    a moment, aware of crisis in the affairs of the Bailey Building and Loan

    George's father is seated behind his desk, nervously drawing swirls on a
    pad. He looks tired and worried. He is a gentle man in his forties, an
    idealist, stubborn only for other people's rights.  Nearby, in a throne-like
    wheelchair, behind which stands the goon who furnishes the motive power,
    sits Henry F.\ Potter, his squarish derby hat on his head. The following
    dialogue is fast and heated, as though the argument had been in process for
    some time.

    George falters off, cupping his aching ear with a hand. Gower looks at the
    large brown bottle which has not been replaced on the shelf. He tears open
    the package, shakes the powder out of one of the capsules, cautiously tastes
    it, then abruptly throws the whole mess to the table and turns to look at

    Well, not just one wish. A whole hatful, Mary. I know what I'm going to do
    tomorrow and the next day and the next year and the year after that. I'm
    shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my feet and I'm going to see
    the world. Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Colosseum.  Then I'm coming
    back here and go to college and see what they know…  and then I'm going to

    There are about twelve directors seated around a long table.  They are the
    substantial citizens of Bedford Falls: Dr.\ Campbell, a lawyer, an insurance
    agent, a real estate salesman, etc.  Prominently seated among them is Henry
    F.\ Potter, his goon beside his wheelchair. Uncle Billy and George are
    seated among the directors. The Chairman of the Board is Dr.\ Campbell. They
    have folders and papers before them, on which they have been reporting.
    Before each of the directors there are individual reports for them to study.
  </p>
  <cue>DR.\ CAMPBELL</cue>

    Now we come to the real purpose of this meeting — to appoint a successor to
    our dear friend, Peter Bailey.

  <d>
    Mr.\ Chairman, I'd like to get to my real purpose.
  </d>
  <cue>MAN</cue>
  <d>
    Wait just a minute now.
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    Wait for what?  I claim this institution is not necessary to this
    town. Therefore, Mr.\ Chairman, I make a motion to dissolve this institution
    and turn its assets and liabilities over to the receiver.

    George, you hear what that buzzard…

    Mr.\ Chairman, it's too soon after Peter Bailey's death to discuss
    chloroforming the Building and Loan.

  <d>
    Peter Bailey died three months ago.  I second Mr.\ Potter's motion.

  <cue>DR.\ CAMPBELL</cue>

    Very well. In that case I'll ask the two executive officers to withdraw.

    Dr.\ Campbell rises from his seat. George and Uncle Billy start to collect
    their papers and leave the table.
  </p>
  <cue>DR.\ CAMPBELL</cue>

    But before you go, I'm sure the whole board wishes to express its deep
    sorrow at the passing of Peter Bailey.

  <d>
    Thank you very much.

  <d>
    It was his faith and devotion that are responsible for this organization.
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    I'll go further than that. I'll say that to the public Peter Bailey was the
    Building and Loan.

    Everyone looks at him surprised.
  </p>
  <cue>UNCLE BILLY</cue>

    Oh, that's fine, Potter, coming from you, considering that you probably
    drove him to his grave.
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    Peter Bailey was not a business man.  That's what killed him. Oh, I don't
    mean any disrespect to him, God rest his soul.  He was a man of high ideals,
    so-called, but ideals without common sense can ruin this town.

    house worth five thousand dollars. Why?

    George is at the door of the office, holding his coat and papers, ready to
    leave.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, I handled that, Mr.\ Potter.  You have all the papers there. His
    salary, insurance. I can personally vouch for his character.

  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <dir>sarcastically</dir>
  <d>

  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Yes, sir.
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    You see, if you shoot pool with some employee here, you can come and borrow
    money. What does that get us? A discontented, lazy rabble instead of a
    thrifty working class. And all because a few starry-eyed dreamers like Peter
    Bailey stir them up and fill their heads with a lot of impossible
    ideas. Now, I say…
  </d>
  <p>
    George puts down his coat and comes around to the table, incensed by what
    Potter is saying about his father.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Just a minute — just a minute. Now, hold on, Mr.\ Potter. You're right when
    you say my father was no business man. I know that. Why he ever started this
    cheap, penny-ante Building and Loan, I'll never know. But neither you nor
    anybody else can say anything against his character, because his whole life
    was… Why, in the twenty- five years since he and Uncle Billy started this
    thing, he never once thought of himself. Isn't that right, Uncle Billy?  He
    didn't save enough money to send Harry to school, let alone me. But he did
    help a few people get out of your slums, Mr.\ Potter.  And what's wrong with
    that? Why…  Here, you're all businessmen here.  Doesn't it make them better
    citizens?  Doesn't it make them better customers?  You… you said… What'd you
    say just a minute ago?… They had to wait and save their money before they
    even ought to think of a decent home. Wait! Wait for what? Until their
    children grow up and leave them?  Until they're so old and broken- down that
    they… Do you know how long it takes a working man to save five thousand
    dollars?  Just remember this, Mr.\ Potter, that this rabble you're talking
    about… they do most of the working and paying and living and dying in this
    community. Well, is it too much to have them work and pay and live and die
    in a couple of decent rooms and a bath? Anyway, my father didn't think
    so. People were human beings to him, but to you, a warped, frustrated old
    man, they're cattle. Well, in my book he died a much richer man than you'll
    ever be!
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    I'm not interested in your book. I'm talking about the Building and Loan.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    I know very well what you're talking about. You're talking about something
    you can't get your fingers on, and it's galling you. That's what you're
    talking about, I know.
  </d>
  <dir>to the Board</dir>
  <d>
    Well, I've said too much. I… You're the Board here. You do what you want
    with this thing. Just one thing more, though. This town needs this measly
    one-horse institution if only to have some place where people can come
    without crawling to Potter.  Come on, Uncle Billy!

  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Tom! Tom! Randall! Now wait… now listen… now listen to me. I beg of you not
    to do this thing. If Potter gets hold of this Building and Loan there'll
    never be another decent house built in this town. He's already got charge of
    the bank.  He's got the bus line. He's got the department stores. And now
    he's after us.  Why?  Well, it's very simple. Because we're cutting in on
    his business, that's why.  And because he wants to keep you living in his
    slums and paying the kind of rent he decides.
  </d>
  <p>
    The people are still trying to get out, but some of them have stood still,
    listening to him. George has begun to make an impression on them.

  <d>
    Here, Ed. You know, you remember last year when things weren't going so
    well, and you couldn't make your payments. You didn't lose your house, did
    you? Do you think Potter would have let you keep it?
  </d>
  <dir>turns to address the room again</dir>
  <d>
    Can't you understand what's happening here? Don't you see what's happening?
    Potter isn't selling. Potter's buying!  And why? Because we're panicky and
    he's not.  That's why. He's picking up some bargains.  Now, we can get
    through this thing all right. We've got to stick together, though. We've got
    to have faith in each other.

  <slug>INT.\ POTTER'S OFFICE - CLOSE SHOT - DAY</slug>
  <p>
    Potter is lighting a big cigar which he has just given George.  The goon is
    beside Potter's chair, as usual.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Thank you, sir. Quite a cigar, Mr.\ Potter.
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    You like it? I'll send you a box.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>nervously</dir>
  <d>
    Well, I… I suppose I'll find out sooner or later, but just what exactly did
    you want to see me about?
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <dir>laughs</dir>
  <d>
    George, now that's just what I like so much about you.
  </d>
  <dir>pleasantly and smoothly</dir>
  <d>
    George, I'm an old man, and most people hate me. But I don't like them
    either, so that makes it all even. You know just as well as I do that I run
    practically everything in this town but the Bailey Building and Loan. You
    know, also, that for a number of years I've been trying to get control of
    it… or kill it. But I haven't been able to do it. You have been stopping
    me. In fact, you have beaten me, George, and as anyone in this county can
    tell you, that takes some doing. Take during the depression, for
    instance. You and I were the only ones that kept our heads. You saved the
    Building and Loan, and I saved all the rest.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Yes. Well, most people say you stole all the rest.
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    The envious ones say that, George, the suckers. Now, I have stated my side
    very frankly. Now, let's look at your side.  Young man, twenty- seven,
    twenty-eight…  married, making, say… forty a week.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>indignantly</dir>
  <d>
    Forty-five!
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    Forty-five. Forty-five. Out of which, after supporting your mother, and
    paying your bills, you're able to keep, say, ten, if you skimp. A child or
    two comes along, and you won't even be able to save the ten. Now, if this
    young man of twenty-eight was a common, ordinary yokel, I'd say he was doing
    fine. But George Bailey is not a common, ordinary yokel. He's an
    intelligent, smart, ambitious young man — who hates his job — who hates the
    Building and Loan almost as much as I do. A young man who's been dying to
    get out on his own ever since he was born. A young man… the smartest one of
    the crowd, mind you, a young man who has to sit by and watch his friends go
    places, because he's trapped.  Yes, sir, trapped into frittering his life
    away playing nursemaid to a lot of garlic-eaters.  Do I paint a correct
    picture, or do I exaggerate?
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>mystified</dir>
  <d>
    Now what's your point, Mr.\ Potter?
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    My point? My point is, I want to hire you.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>dumbfounded</dir>
  <d>
    Hire me?
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    I want you to manage my affairs, run my properties. George, I'll start you
    out at twenty thousand dollars a year.
  </d>
  <p>
    George drops his cigar on his lap. He nervously brushes off the sparks from
    his clothes.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>flabbergasted</dir>
  <d>
    Twenty thou… twenty thousand dollars a year?
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town, buying your wife a lot
    of fine clothes, a couple of business trips to New York a year, maybe once
    in a while Europe. You wouldn't mind that, would you, George?
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Would I?
  </d>
  <dir>looking around skeptically</dir>
  <d>
    You're not talking to somebody else around here, are you? You know, this is
    me, you remember me? George Bailey.
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, yes, George Bailey. Whose ship has just come in — providing he has
    brains enough to climb aboard.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, what about the Building and Loan?
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, confound it, man, are you afraid of success? I'm offering you a three
    year contract at twenty thousand dollars a year, starting today. Is it a
    deal or isn't it?
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, Mr.\ Potter, I… I… I know I ought to jump at the chance, but I… I
    just…  I wonder if it would be possible for you to give me twenty- four
    hours to think it over?
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    Sure, sure, sure. You go on home and talk about it to your wife.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    I'd like to do that.
  </d>
  <cue>POTTER</cue>
  <d>
    In the meantime, I'll draw up the papers.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    All right, sir.

  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>taking his hand</dir>
  <d>
    Okay, Mr.\ Potter.
  </d>
  <p>
    As they shake hands, George feels a physical revulsion.  Potter's hand feels
    like a cold mackerel to him. In that moment of physical contact he knows he
    could never be associated with this man.  George drops his hand with a
    shudder. He peers intently into Potter's face.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>vehemently</dir>
  <d>
    No… no… no… no, now wait a minute, here!  I don't have to talk to anybody!
    I know right now, and the answer is no! NO!  Doggone it!
  </d>
  <dir>getting madder all the time</dir>
  <d>
    You sit around here and you spin your little webs and you think the whole
    world revolves around you and your money. Well, it doesn't, Mr.\ Potter!  In
    the… in the whole vast configuration of things, I'd say you were nothing but
    a scurvy little spider. You…
  </d>
  <p>
    He turns and shouts at the goon, impassive as ever beside Potter's
    wheelchair.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    …And that goes for you too!
  </d>
  <p>
    As George opens the office door to exit, he shouts at Mr.\ Potter's
    secretary in the outer office
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    And it goes for you too!
  </d>
  <slug>INT.\ BEDROOM - GEORGE AND MARY'S HOUSE - CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT</slug>
  <p>
    George enters the bedroom. The room is modestly furnished with just a cheap
    bed, a chair or two, and a dresser. Mary is asleep in the bed. As George
    comes in, his head is filled with many confusing thoughts, relating to
    incidents in his past life.
  </p>
  <cue>POTTER'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    You wouldn't mind living in the nicest house in town. Buying your wife a lot
    of fine clothes, going to New York on a business trip a couple of times a
    year.  Maybe to Europe once in a while.
  </d>
  <p>
    George takes off his hat and coat, moves over to the dresser and stares at
    his reflection in the mirror.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    I know what I'm going to do tomorrow and the next day and next year and the
    year after that. I'm shaking the dust of this crummy little town off my
    feet, and I'm going to see the world… And I'm going to build things. I'm
    going to build air fields.  I'm going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories
    high. I'm going to build a bridge a mile long.
  </d>
  <p>
    While the above thoughts are passing through George's head, his attention is
    caught by a picture on the wall near the dresser:
  </p>
  <p>
    INSERT: PICTURE ON THE WALL
  </p>
  <p>
    It is the sketch of George lassoing the moon that we first saw in Mary's
    living room. The lettering reads: “George Lassos The Moon.”
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE'S VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    What is it you want, Mary? You want the moon? If you do, just say the word;
    I'll throw a lasso around it and pull it down for you.
  </d>
  <p>
    Mary is now awake, and starts singing their theme song:
  </p>
  <cue>MARY</cue>

  <d>
    Buffalo Gals, won't you come out tonight, won't you come out tonight, won't
    you come out tonight.

    You could have married Sam Wainwright or anybody else in town.

  <cue>MARY</cue>
  <d>
    I didn't want to marry anybody else in town. I want my baby to look like
    you.

    home from Washington after receiving the Congressional Medal of
    Honor. There's a large picture of President Truman pinning the coveted medal
    on Harry's bosom, in the midst of dignitaries; a picture of the transport

    The SOUND of Janie at the piano can be heard, the same monotonous rhythm

    beside her. She is holding her prize flower.  George tiptoes in. Then, as he

    She puts a restraining hand on his arm. He shakes it off.  She cannot know

    Welch's voice sputtering with protest.

    Is this the sort of thing we pay taxes for — to have teachers like you?

    God… God… Dear Father in Heaven, I'm not a praying man, but if you're up

    George's car comes along the empty street, through the falling snow,
    suddenly swerves and crashes into a tree near the sidewalk of a house.
    George gets out to look at the damage, and savagely kicks at the open door

  <p>
    The man in the water is Clarence, the angel whose voice we have heard

  <slug>
    INT.\ TOLL HOUSE ON BRIDGE - MED.\ SHOT - GEORGE, CLARENCE, AND THE
    TOLLKEEPER - NIGHT
  </slug>
  <p>
    George is seated before a wood-burning stove before which his clothes are
    drying on a line. He is in his long winter underwear.  He is sipping a mug
    of hot coffee, staring at the stove, cold, gloomy and drunk, ignoring
    Clarence and the tollkeeper, preoccupied by his near suicide and his
    unsolved problems.  Clarence is standing on the other side of the stove,
    putting on his undershirt. This is a ludicrous seventeenth century garment
    which looks like a baby's night shirt — with embroidered cuffs and collar,
    and gathered at the neck with a drawstring. It falls below his knees.  The
    tollkeeper is seated against the wall eyeing them suspiciously. Throughout
    the scene he attempts to spit, but each time is stopped by some amazing
    thing Clarence does or says.  Clarence becomes aware that his garment is
    amazing the tollkeeper.
  </p>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    I didn't have time to get some stylish underwear. My wife gave me this on my
    last birthday. I passed away in it.
  </d>
  <p>
    The tollkeeper, about to spit, is stopped in the middle of it by this
    remark. Clarence, secretly trying to get George's attention, now picks up a
    copy of “Tom Sawyer” which is hanging on the line, drying. He shakes the
    book.
  </p>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, Tom Sawyer's drying out, too.  You should read the new book Mark Twain's
    writing now.
  </d>
  <p>
    The tollkeeper stares at him incredulously.
  </p>
  <cue>TOLLKEEPER</cue>
  <d>
    How'd you happen to fall in?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    I didn't fall in. I jumped in to save George.
  </d>
  <p>
    George looks up, surprised.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    You what? To save me?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, I did, didn't I? You didn't go through with it, did you?
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Go through with what?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Suicide.
  </d>
  <p>
    George and the tollkeeper react to this.
  </p>
  <cue>TOLLKEEPER</cue>
  <d>
    It's against the law to commit suicide around here.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Yeah, it's against the law where I come from, too.
  </d>
  <cue>TOLLKEEPER</cue>
  <d>
    Where do you come from?
  </d>
  <p>
    He leans forward to spit, but is stopped by Clarence's next statement.
  </p>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Heaven.
  </d>
  <dir>to George</dir>
  <d>
    I had to act quickly; that's why I jumped in. I knew if I were drowning
    you'd try to save me. And you see, you did, and that's how I saved you.
  </d>
  <p>
    The tollkeeper becomes increasingly nervous. George casually looks at the
    strange smiling little man a second time.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>offhand</dir>
  <d>
    Very funny.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>

  <p>
    George's hand goes to his mouth.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Yeah, I got a bust in the jaw in answer to a prayer a little bit ago.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <dir>comes around to George</dir>
  <d>
    Oh, no — no — no. I'm the answer to your prayer. That's why I was sent down
    here.

  <d>
    How do you know my name?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, I know all about you. I've watched you grow up from a little boy.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    What are you, a mind reader or something?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, no.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, who are you, then?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Clarence Odbody, A-S-2.

  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Odbody… A-S-2. What's that A-S-2?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Angel, Second Class.
  </d>
  <p>
    The tollkeeper's chair slips out from under him with a crash.  He has been
    leaning against the wall on it, tipped back on two legs.  Tollkeeper rises
    and makes his way warily out the door. From his expression he looks like
    he'll call the nearest cop.
  </p>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <dir>to tollkeeper</dir>
  <d>
    Cheerio, my good man.

    George rubs his head with his hand, to clear his mind.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, brother. I wonder what Martini put in those drinks?
  </d>
  <p>
    He looks up at Clarence standing beside him.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Hey, what's with you? What did you say just a minute ago? Why'd you want to
    save me?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    That's what I was sent down for. I'm your guardian angel.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    I wouldn't be a bit surprised.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>

  <d>
    Yeah… just things like that. Now how'd you know that?

    I told you — I'm your guardian angel.  I know everything about you.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, you look about like the kind of an angel I'd get. Sort of a fallen
    angel, aren't you? What happened to your wings?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    I haven't won my wings yet. That's why I'm an angel Second Class.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    I don't know whether I like it very much being seen around with an angel
    without any wings.

  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Only one way you can help me. You don't happen to have eight thousand bucks
    on you?
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, no, no. We don't use money in Heaven.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>

    bar, tables have no covers. People are lower down and tougher. Nick the
    bartender is behind the bar. George and Clarence come in. George does not
    notice the difference, but Clarence is all eyes and beaming. They go up to
    the bar.

    town. As he goes, CAMERA MOVES WITH him. The character of the place has
    completely changed. Where before it was a quiet, orderly small town, it has
    now become in nature like a frontier village. We see a SERIES OF SHOTS of
    night clubs, cafes, bars, liquor stores, pool halls and the like, with
    blaring jazz MUSIC issuing from the majority of them. The motion picture
    theatre has become a burlesque house. Gower's drugstore is now a

    George runs up the path to the front door of the house and raps on the
    door. He rings the bell and taps on the glass, when his attention is caught
    by a sign on the wall reading:  “Ma Bailey's Boarding House.”
  </p>
  <slug>MED.\ CLOSEUP - GEORGE AT THE DOOR</slug>
  <p>
    The door opens and a woman appears. It is Mrs.\ Bailey, but she has changed
    amazingly. Her face is harsh and tired. In her eyes, once kindly and
    understanding, there is now cold suspicion. She gives no sign that she knows
    him.
  </p>

    Well?

  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Mother…
  </d>
  <cue>MA BAILEY</cue>

    Mother? What do you want?
  </d>
  <p>
    It is a cruel blow to George.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Mother, this is George. I thought sure you'd remember me.

  <cue>MA BAILEY</cue>
  <dir>coldly</dir>
  <d>
    George who? If you're looking for a room there's no vacancy.
  </d>
  <p>
    She starts to close the door, but George stops her.
  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, Mother, Mother, please help me.  Something terrible's happened to me.  I
    don't know what it is. Something's happened to everybody. Please let me come
    in. Keep me here until I get over it.
  </d>
  <cue>MA BAILEY</cue>
  <d>
    Get over what? I don't take in strangers unless they're sent here by
    somebody I know.
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>

  <d>
    Well, I know everybody you know.  Your brother-in-law, Uncle Billy.

  <d>
    When'd you see him last?

  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Today, over at the house.
  </d>
  <cue>MA BAILEY</cue>
  <d>
    That's a lie. He's been in the insane asylum ever since he lost his
    business.  And if you ask me, that's where you belong.

  <p>
    She slams the door shut in George's face.
  </p>
  <slug>EXT.\ HOUSE - MED.\ CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT</slug>
  <p>
    George stands a moment, stunned. Then he turns and runs out to the sidewalk,
    until his face fills the screen. His features are distorted by the emotional
    chaos within him. We see Clarence leaning on the mail box at the curb,
    holding his volume of “Tom Sawyer” in his hand.
  </p>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Strange, isn't it?  Each man's life touches so many other lives, and when he

  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <dir>quietly, trying to use logic</dir>
  <d>
    I've heard of things like this. You've got me in some kind of a spell, or
    something.  Well, I'm going to get out of it. I'll get out of it. I know
    how, too. I… the last man I talked to before all this stuff started
    happening to me was Martini.
  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>

    You know where he lives?
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>

  </p>
  <slug>EXT.\ CEMETERY - MED.\ SHOT - NIGHT</slug>
  <p>
    George and Clarence approach the tree from which the “Bailey Park” sign once
    hung. Now it is just outside a cemetery, with graves where the houses used
    to be.
  </p>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <d>
    Are you sure this is Bailey Park?
  </d>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, I'm not sure of anything anymore.  All I know is this should be Bailey
    Park. But where are the houses?

  <slug>CLOSE MOVING SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    George wandering like a lost soul among the tombstones, Clarence trotting at
    his heels. Again George stops to stare with frightened eyes at:
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT - A TOMBSTONE</slug>
  <p>
    Upon it is engraved a name, Harry Bailey. Feverishly George scrapes away the
    snow covering the rest of the inscription, and we read: “IN MEMORY OF OUR
    BELOVED SON — HARRY BAILEY — 1911-1919”
  </p>

  </p>
  <cue>GEORGE</cue>

    That's a lie! Harry Bailey went to war! He got the Congressional Medal of

  </d>
  <cue>CLARENCE</cue>
  <dir>sadly</dir>
  <d>
    Every man on that transport died.  Harry wasn't there to save them because
    you weren't there to save Harry. You see, George, you really had a wonderful

  <slug>EXT.\ LIBRARY - CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT</slug>
  <p>
    Mary comes out the door, then turns and locks it. We see George watching her
    from the sidewalk. Mary is very different — no buoyancy in her walk, none of
    Mary's abandon and love of life.  Glasses, no make-up, lips compressed,
    elbows close to body. She looks flat and dried up, and extremely self-
    satisfied and efficient.

    He catches up to her, grabs her by the arms, and keeps a tight grip on

    Mary breaks away from him, and dashes into the first door she comes to, the

  </p>
  <slug>INT.\ BLUE MOON - CLOSE SHOT - NIGHT</slug>
  <p>
    Small tables, booths, perhaps a counter. It is crowded. Many of the people
    are the same who were present during the run on the Building and Loan. Mary
    comes running in, screaming.  The place goes into an uproar. George comes
    in, practically insane. Some of the men grab and hold on to him.

    He grabs for George, who lets him have one square on the button, knocking

    Come in, Uncle Billy! Everybody! In here!

  <p>
    Uncle Billy Mary and the crowd come into the living room. A table stands in
    front of George. George picks up Zuzu to protect her from the mob. Uncle
    Billy dumps the basketful of money out onto the table — the money overflows
    and falls all over.
  </p>

    Isn't it wonderful?
  </d>
  <p>
    The rest of the crowd all greet George with greetings and smiles.  Each one
    comes forward with money. In their pockets, in shoe boxes, in coffee
    pots. Money pours onto the table — pennies, dimes, quarters, dollar bills —
    small money, but lots of it. Mrs.\ Bailey and Mrs.\ Hatch push toward
    George.  More people come in. The place becomes a bedlam. Shouts of “Gangway
    — gangway” as a new bunch comes in and pours out its money. Mary stands next
    to George, watching him. George stands there overcome and speechless as he
    holds Zuzu. As he sees the familiar faces, he gives them sick grins.  Tears
    course down his face. His lips frame their names as he greets them.

    Mary did it, George! Mary did it!  She told a few people you were in trouble
    and they scattered all over town collecting money.  They didn't ask any
    questions — just said: “If George is in trouble — count on me.”  You never
    saw anything like it.

    Tom comes in, digging in his purse as he comes.

    Mr.\ Martini comes in bearing a mixing bowl overflowing with cash.

    Annie, the colored maid, enters, digging money out of a long black stocking.

    Mr.\ Gower cables you need cash. Stop.  My office instructed to advance you

    The crowd breaks into a cheer as Ernie drops the telegram on top of the pile
    of money on the table.

    As various members of the family bring out a punch bowl and glasses, Janie
    sits down at the piano and strikes a chord.  She starts playing “Hark! The
    Herald Angels Sing,” and the entire crowd joins in the singing. We see a
    SERIES OF SHOTS of the various groups singing the hymn, and some people are
    still coming in and dropping their money on the table. Carter, the bank
    examiner, makes a donation; the sheriff sheepishly looks at George and tears
    his warrant in small pieces. In the midst of this scene, Harry, in Naval
    uniform, enters, accompanied by Bert, the cop.

    Ernie hands Harry a glass of wine.

    Good idea, Ernie. A toast… to my big brother, George. The richest man in
    town!

    Once more the crowd breaks into cheering and applause. Janie at the piano
    and Bert on his accordion start playing “Auld Lang syne,” and everyone joins
    in.

    George, still holding Zuzu in his arms, glances down at the pile of money on
    the table. His eye catches something on top of the pile, and he reaches down
    for it. It is Clarence's copy of “Tom Sawyer.” George opens it and finds an
    inscription written in it: “Dear George, remember no man is a failure who
    has friends. Thanks for the wings, Love Clarence.”

    What's that?

  <cue>GEORGE</cue>
  <d>
    That's a Christmas present from a very dear friend of mine.
  </d>
  <p>
    At this moment, perhaps because of the jostling of some of the people on the
    other side of the tree, a little silver bell on the Christmas tree swings to
    and fro with a silvery tinkle. Zuzu closes the cover of the book, and points
    to the bell.

    Look, Daddy. Teacher says, every time a bell rings an angel gets his wings.
