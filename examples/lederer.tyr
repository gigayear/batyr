  <slug>INT.\ ANTEROOM - CLOSE SHOT - SWITCHBOARD</slug>
  <p>
    Two telephone operators sit at switchboard busy plugging in and out
    answering calls.
  </p>
  <cue>1ST OPERATOR</cue>
  <d>
    This is the Morning Post… The City Room? Just a moment, I'll connect you.

  <p>
    CAMERA PULLS BACK to disclose the rest of the anteroom. To Camera left are
    the elevators — at back wall directly behind switchboard are chairs and a
    table for visitors. Next to switchboard are stairs leading downward to the
    next floor. A waist-high iron grill with a gate in it separates the
    switchboard from the anteroom, a similar grill separating it again from the
    city room which stretches on beyond switchboard. At a table in the
    switchboard enclosure sits an office boy, about fifteen, doing a crossword
    puzzle. The big clock on the back wall shows that it is nearly one o'clock.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT - OFFICE BOY</slug>
  <p>
    as he bends over paper. We catch a glimpse of the squares of a crossword
    puzzle.
  </p>
  <slug>MED.\ SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    as a reporter comes out of the City Room, clanging gate to behind him. The
    office boy looks up.
  </p>
  <cue>OFFICE BOY</cue>
  <d>
    What's a seven-letter word for —?
  </d>
  <cue>REPORTER</cue>
  <d>
    Don't ask me! If I knew any seven- letter words, I'd be something better
    than a reporter!
  </d>
  <p>
    He catches a glimpse of the far elevator going down.
  </p>
  <cue>REPORTER</cue>
  <d>
    Hey! Down! Down!
  </d>
  <slug>MED.\ SHOT - ELEVATORS</slug>
  <p>
    as reporter runs in to the closed elevator door and pounds on it. It comes
    back, the door opens, and he gets in. The door closes, as elevator goes
    down. The near elevator comes up and discharges Hildy Johnson and Bruce
    Baldwin. Bruce carries an umbrella and wears a raincoat.
  </p>

    office boy looking over his puzzle as Hildy and Bruce come into the scene.

    Hildy Johnson!

  <d>
    Hello, Maisie.
  </d>
  <p>
    The first operator looks up.
  </p>
  <cue>MAISIE</cue>
  <d>
    Hello — Hildy! You coming back?
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    No, just visiting. Tell me, is the lord of the universe in today?
  </d>
  <cue>MAISIE</cue>
  <d>
    He is — and in a very bad humor. I think somebody stole one of his crown
    jewels. Shall I announce you?
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    No, never mind — I'll blow my own trumpet.

  <slug>THREE SHOT - BRUCE, HILDY AND OPERATOR</slug>
  <p>
    Hildy turns to Bruce.
  </p>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    I won't be more than ten minutes, I promise you.
  </d>
  <cue>BRUCE</cue>
  <d>
    Even ten minutes is a long time to be away from you.
  </d>
  <p>
    We hear a giggle off scene.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT - OFFICE BOY</slug>
  <p>
    He looks towards Bruce and Hildy and giggles.
  </p>
  <slug>TWO SHOT - BRUCE AND HILDY</slug>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    What did you say, Bruce?
  </d>
  <p>
    Bruce, embarrassed, looks at the office boy, then looks back at Hildy as
    they turn toward second gate leading into City Room.
  </p>
  <cue>BRUCE</cue>
  <d>
    I said — uh — I said even ten minutes — is a long time — to be away from
    you.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Don't be embarrassed, Bruce. I heard it, but I just wanted to hear it
    again. I can stand being spoiled a little. The gentleman I'm going to have a
    chat with did very little spoiling.
  </d>
  <cue>BRUCE</cue>
  <dir>grimly</dir>
  <d>
    I'd like to spoil him just once.  Sure you don't want me to go in with you?
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    My job, Bruce. I started it — and I'll finish it.
  </d>
  <cue>BRUCE</cue>
  <d>
    I suppose you're right — but if it gets rough, remember I'm here.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    I'll come a-running, pardner.
  </d>
  <p>
    She starts to push open the iron-grilled gate leading into the City
    Room. Bruce quickly springs forward and opens it for her. Hildy smiles.
  </p>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Thanks, Bruce.
  </d>
  <p>
    She kisses his cheek and walks through. He looks after her.  The office boy
    whistles. Bruce pays no attention, but stares after Hildy.
  </p>
  <slug>MEDIUM SHOT - SHOOTING DOWN LENGTH OF CITY ROOM</slug>
  <p>
    Hildy starts to walk through City Room.
  </p>
  <slug>TRUCKING SHOT - HILDY</slug>
  <p>
    as she walks the length of the City Room. It's a long walk, because it's a
    room that takes up practically the whole floor.  The scene is a busy
    one. But, gradually, as Hildy starts down, one after another recognize
    her. There are cries of:  “Hildy!” “Hello, Hildy”, etc., from the men as
    Hildy goes straight down the aisle. She never stops but waves her own
    greetings: “Jim!” “Hi, good-looking!” “Laura” “Hullo, Pop” “Nan!” “Eddie!”
    “Hello, Mac” “Pete!” “Frank” “Oscar!”, and gets responses from each of
    them. One man is bent over his desk reading his copy — he is standing
    up. Hildy slaps him as she goes by. He turns around: “Say, who did that?” As
    he sees Hildy: “Hello, Hildy!” Hildy: “Hi, Jake.” She passes a middle-aged
    woman, almost an Edna May Oliver type, seated at a desk pounding out copy
    and smoking a cigarette. As Hildy comes up to her she slaps the woman on the
    back.
  </p>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Hello, Beatrice. How's “Advice to the Lovelorn”?
  </d>
  <cue>BEATRICE</cue>
  <dir>looking up</dir>
  <d>
    Hildy! I'll be a monkey's uncle!  What are you doing here?

    My advice is duck and cross with your right.
  </d>
  <p>
    Hildy moves on. CAMERA TRUCKS WITH HER to the end of the room where she
    pauses before the frosted glass partition which separates Walter Burns'
    office from the rest of the City Room.
  </p>
  <slug>INT.\ BURNS' OFFICE - LONG SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    as she opens the door. Burns is shaving with an electric razor and Louie is
    holding the mirror up in front of him.

  <cue>LOUIE</cue>
  <d>
    A little more round the chin, Boss.
  </d>
  <slug>MEDIUM SHOT</slug>
  <p>
    There is a sound of the door closing and Burns, without looking up, says:
  </p>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    What do you want?
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Why, I'm surprised, Mr.\ Burns. That's no way to talk to your wife — even if
    she's no longer your wife.
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <dir>grinning</dir>

    Hello, Hildy!
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Hello, Walter.

  <dir>to Louie</dir>
  <d>
    Hi, Louie — how's the slotmachine king?
  </d>
  <cue>LOUIE</cue>
  <d>
    Oh, I ain't doing that any more. I'm retired. I'm one of you fellas now — a
    newspaper man.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Editorials?
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Get going, Louie. I got company.
  </d>
  <p>
    The door flies open and Duffy comes busting in.
  </p>
  <cue>DUFFY</cue>
  <d>
    Walter!
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    I'm busy, Duffy.
  </d>
  <cue>DUFFY</cue>
  <d>
    Well, you're not too busy to know that the Governor hasn't signed that
    reprieve!
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    What?
  </d>
  <cue>DUFFY</cue>
  <d>
    And that means Earl Williams dies tomorrow morning and makes a sucker out of
    us!
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    You're crazy. Where's Mac?
  </d>
  <cue>DUFFY</cue>
  <d>
    He's on my phone. He just called me.
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    They can't do that to me!
  </d>
  <p>
    He grabs the phone on his desk:
  </p>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Give me that call on Duffy's wire!  Hello — Mac? Burns. Where's the
    Governor? — What do you mean, you can't locate him?
  </d>
  <dir>apparently pleading to the one man in the world who can help him</dir>
  <d>
    Mac, you know what this means. We're the only paper in town defending Earl
    Williams and if he hangs tomorrow we're washed up! Find the Governor and
    when you find him tell him we want that reprieve!… Tell him I elected him
    and I can have him impeached! Sure, you can do it, Mac — I know you can. I
    always said you were the greatest reporter in the country and now you can
    prove it.  Get going! Attaboy!
  </d>
  <p>
    He hangs up.
  </p>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <dir>to Duffy, sarcastically</dir>
  <d>
    The greatest reporter in the country!  First I gotta tell him what news to
    get! Gotta tell him how to get it — then I gotta write it for him afterward!
    Now if you were a decent City Editor —

    with Louie and Hildy in the b.g.
  </p>
  <cue>DUFFY</cue>

    Don't blame me. I'm City Editor in name only. You do all the hiring around
    here.
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Yeah! Well, I do the firing, too.  Remember that, Duffy, and Keep a civil
    tongue in your head.

    I don't like to interfere with business, but would you boys pardon us while

    Well — But I gotta —

    They look at Burns.
  </p>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Scram, you guys.
  </d>
  <p>
    They start to go.
  </p>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    You won't miss anything. You'll probably be able to hear him just as well
    outside as here.
  </d>
  <p>
    They go.
  </p>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Mind if I sit down?
  </d>
  <p>
    Hildy sits.
  </p>
  <slug>CLOSE SHOT - DUFFY AND LOUIE</slug>
  <p>
    going out of the door. They cast an interested look back and linger a
    second. Over scene comes Burns' voice.
  </p>
  <cue>BURNS' VOICE</cue>
  <d>
    I said scram!
  </d>
  <p>
    They close the door hurriedly.

  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    May I have a cigarette, please?
  </d>
  <p>
    Burns reaches into his pocket, extracts a cigarette and tosses it on the
    desk. Hildy reaches for it.
  </p>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Thanks. A match?
  </d>
  <p>
    Burns delves into pockets again, comes up with matchbox, tosses it to Hildy,
    who catches it deftly, and strikes the match.
  </p>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    How long is it?
  </d>
  <p>
    Hildy finishes lighting her cigarette, takes a puff, and fans out the match.
  </p>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    How long is what?
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    You know what. How long since we've seen each other?
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Let's see. I was in Reno six weeks — then Bermuda… Oh, about four months, I
    guess. Seems like yesterday to me.

  <d>
    I notice you still remember it.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    I'll always remember it. If I hadn't remembered it, I wouldn't have divorced
    you.
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    You know, Hildy, I sort of wish you hadn't done it.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Done what?
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Divorced me. It sort of makes a fellow lose faith in himself. It almost
    gives him a feeling he wasn't wanted.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Holy mackerel! Look, Walter, that's what divorces are for.
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Nonsense. You've got the old-fashioned idea that divorces are something that
    last forever — till 'death us do part'. Why, a divorce doesn't mean anything
    today. It's only a few words mumbled over you by a judge.  We've got
    something between us nothing can change.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    I suppose that's true in a way. I am fond of you, Walter. I often wish you
    weren't such a stinker.
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Now, that's a nice thing to say.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Well, why did you promise me you wouldn't fight the divorce and then try and
    gum up the whole works?
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>

    Well, I meant to let you go — but, you know, you never miss the water till

    Well, I don't want to brag, but I've still got the dimple — and in the same

    What home? Don't you remember the home I promised you?

    Oh, yes — we were to have it right after our honeymoon — honeymoon!
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>

    Was it my fault? Did I know that coal mine was going to have another
    cave-in? I meant to be with you on our honeymoon, Hildy — honest I did.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    All I know is that instead of two weeks in Atlantic City with my bridegroom,
    I spent two weeks in a coal mine with John Kruptzky — age sixty-three —
    getting food and air out of a tube! You don't deny that.  Do you?
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Deny it! I'm proud of it! We beat the whole country on that story.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Well, suppose we did? That isn't what I got married for. What's the good of
    — Look, Walter, I came up here to tell you that you'll have to stop phoning
    me a dozen times a day — sending twenty telegrams — all the rest of it,
    because I'm —
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Let's not fight, Hildy. Tell you what. You come back to work on the paper
    and if we find we can't get along in a friendly way, we'll get married
    again.

  <d>
    I haven't any hard feelings.

    Walter, you're wonderful in a loathesome sort of way. Now, would you mind

  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    I might have, Walter, but you were never there.
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Anyway, I'm glad you two are going to be happy and have all the things I
    couldn't give her. You know, Hildy is about the best reporter in the country
    — and that goes regardless of sex. But all she really ever wanted was a
    home.
  </d>
  <cue>BRUCE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, I'll try to give her one.

  <cue>BURNS</cue>

    That'll be nice. A home with mother.  A real honeymoon. In Albany, too.  Ow!

  <p>
    That “ow” is sotto voce, but it's the direct result of a kick under the
    table from Hildy.
  </p>
  <cue>BRUCE</cue>
  <d>
    Mighty nice little town, Albany.  They've got the State Capitol there, you

  </d>
  <cue>BRUCE</cue>
  <d>
    Well, I honestly feel that way. I figure I'm in one line of business that

    He hangs up, smiles, and finishes the coffee. Then he girds himself for

    They are all talking at once as Hildy comes into the scene.  There are ad

    etc. Hildy raises her hand for silence.

  </d>
  <p>
    She enters to a desk, places her bag on top of the desk, takes her hat off
    and hangs it on a clothes tree in the corner, comes back to desk and opens
    the travelling bag. All through the above action she is talking rapidly.
  </p>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    No, I'm not back for good. I'm just covering the Earl Williams story for
    Mr.\ Sweeney who had a sudden attack of something but will be all right by
    tomorrow. No, I haven't made up with Walter Burns — far from it! As a matter
    of fact, I'm leaving tonight for Albany and I'll be married tomorrow
    morning. The lucky man is Mr.\ Bruce Baldwin, a gentleman in the insurance
    business — and when I say gentleman, I mean gentleman! Are there any other
    questions?

    Hildy takes notebook and pencil out of bag, looks at the stockings she is

    Good. Now I want to ask you fellows a couple of questions. Did Earl Williams
    know what he was doing when he fired that gun?
  </d>
  <cue>MURPHY</cue>
  <d>
    If you ask us, no. If you ask the state alienists, the answer is yes.
  </d>
  <cue>McCUE</cue>
  <d>
    It's a simple story. Earl Williams works for the E.J.\ McClosky
    Manufacturing Company as a bookkeeper for fourteen years. He starts in at
    twenty dollars a week and gradually works his way up to twenty-two fifty.  A
    year ago the McClosky Company goes out of business and Williams loses his
    job.

  <dir>waving his hand toward Wilson</dir>

  </d>
  <cue>WILSON</cue>
  <d>
    Well — Williams goes a little balmy and begins making speeches on a plan
    he's got to save the world. Only he makes his speeches, usually, on a very
    busy street and neglects to get a license for it. Well, the cops let him
    alone as much as they can because he's harmless and they're kinda sorry for
    him. But one day he decides to hold a meeting right in the middle of a
    Veteran's Parade and the cops chase him. He gets scared and goes into
    hiding.

    His Honor, the Mayor, now comes out with a statement that Earl Williams is a
    dangerous character in the employ of two or three foreign governments and
    the police are going to get him dead or alive. Somebody sends out a tip that
    this guy is hiding in Molly Malloy's joint. And this colored policeman,
    Daniels, goes over to pick Williams up. Williams has read the papers, thinks
    the cop is going to kill him and shoots first. That is all.

    facing Hildy. There is a bouquet of roses in a water pitcher by the cot. Our
    first impression of Williams is that he's a rational, well-poised
    citizen. It is only under Hildy's questioning that he gradually reveals
    himself.

  <d>
    You didn't mean to kill that policeman?
  </d>
  <cue>WILLIAMS</cue>
  <d>
    Of course not. I couldn't kill anybody — it's against everything I've ever
    stood for. They know it was an accident. They're not hanging me for that —
    they're hanging me for my beliefs.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    What are your beliefs, Earl?
  </d>
  <cue>WILLIAMS</cue>
  <d>
    They're very simple. I believe in the Golden Rule. I'm not the first man to
    die for preaching it. But if they would only listen to it — we could have a
    fine, decent world instead of this mass of hate that makes man do such cruel
    things.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    How would you go about applying the Golden Rule, Earl?
  </d>
  <cue>WILLIAMS</cue>
  <d>
    I'd do away with the profit system and have production for use only.
    There's enough food and clothing and shelter for everybody if we'd use some
    sense.
  </d>

  <d>
    “Production for use only.” Well, maybe that's the answer.
  </d>
  <cue>WILLIAMS</cue>
  <d>
    It's the only answer. Everything has a use and if we let it be used for its
    purpose, we could solve all our problems. Food was meant to be eaten, not
    stored away in restaurants while poor people starved; clothing was meant to
    be worn, not piled up in stores while people went naked.  Doesn't that make
    sense?

    Hello, Jake. Here's a red-hot statement from the Governor. He claims that
    the Mayor and the Sheriff have shown themselves to be a couple of
    eight-year-olds playing with fire.

    the Mayor and the Sheriff.”  That's all — call you back.

    Hildy stops short, arrested by a sound from the open window.  She turns and
    sees Earl Williams, looking more inoffensive and exhausted than ever, indeed
    on the verge of collapse. He carries a large revolver. The search-lights
    that have been playing in the courtyard strike into the windows again.

    No, no, you're right. I don't want to kill anybody. All I want to do is be

    He drops the gun and clutches at the edge of the desk for support. Hildy
    lurches forward and she grabs the other side of the desk for support. And at
    this moment she looks more tired than he does. She looks at Earl and
    breathes heavily.

    He abruptly crumples and falls to the floor. Hildy stands for a second,
    desperate. Then she picks him up and half carries, half drags him over

    Yeah. What about the time we hid the missing heiress in the sauerkraut

  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Yeah - but that time we stole Old Lady Haggerty's stomach off the Coroner's

    Don't remind me. That's how we happened to —

    Sorry, Hildy. I didn't mean to be making love to another man's fiancee.

    Well, if it's my last story, I'd like it to be a good one. But — I guess I
    can't, Walter.
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Suit yourself, kid. This isn't for me to decide. Of course, you could make a

    It's awfully clear now. Bruce needs a wife who can give him a home — and

    open?

  <cue>BURNS</cue>

    Both jobs are open, Hildy. The paper — and being Mrs.\ Walter Burns.

  <cue>HILDY</cue>
  <d>
    Thanks, Walter, but it's no good. We tried it.
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    Sure, it was good — it was wonderful!  Only you expected it to be like other
    marriages. It can't be like other marriages — we're different! We're a
    different world. Look at what we went through today. I wouldn't trade that
    for any honeymoon in the world.  I bet you wouldn't, either.
  </d>
  <cue>HILDY</cue>

    A fine honeymoon, with a murderer right in the boudoir! And that other
    honeymoon in a coal mine!
  </d>
  <cue>BURNS</cue>
  <d>
    That's what makes it romantic. Every other married couple goes away on a
    honeymoon and for two weeks the bride knows just where the groom is, and
    vice versa. But us — you never know where I am and I'm not sure where you
    are. That's Romance!
